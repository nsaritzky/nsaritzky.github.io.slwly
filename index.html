    <h2>I'm Nathan Saritzky, a programmer, problem solver, runner, and lapsed mathematician.</h2>
<p><img alt="Me" src="/images/portrait.jpg" width="200px"></p>
<p>Up until 2018, I had spent my post-college (and in-college) life working towards a Ph.D. in algebraic geometry. After a few years at the University of Washington, I realized that it wasn't for me. I enjoy learning broadly, and an academic career is about learning a very narrow slice of something. I want a good, stable career, a luxury many postdocs never find. And while it can be great to feel invested in my work, I want to be able to engage with the rest of my life without feeling guilty that I'm not doing research.</p>
<p>Since then, I've turned my attention away from pure mathematics and towards software development. I've spent my entire adult life learning to solve difficult, abstract problems. Now I have a chance to combine that with my broader interests and to enter new areas that, before, I didn't have the time or space for. Here is where I plan to share the results.</p>
<p>When I'm not working, I like to run (slowly, and for a long time) and play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">Go</a> (also slowly). I'm working hard to improve at both, and both serve as inspirations for my personal projects.</p>
